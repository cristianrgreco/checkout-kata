# Checkout Kata

Implement the code for a checkout system that handles pricing schemes such as "pineapples cost 50, three pineapples cost 130."

In a normal supermarket, things are identified using Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs. In our store, weâ€™ll use individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on). Our goods are priced individually. 

| SKU  | Unit Price | Special Price |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------- |
| A    | 50         | 3 for 130     |
| B    | 30         | 2 for 45      |
| C    | 20         |               |
| D    | 15         |               |

The checkout accepts items in any order.

The interface to the checkout could look like:

```java
interface Checkout
{
    void scan(string sku);
    int getTotalPrice();
}
```
